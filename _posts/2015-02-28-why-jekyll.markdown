When I decided to write this blog, the first question that comes to my mind was: **Should I use Wordpress or Jekyll?**. After reading various posts ([here][blog1], [here][blog2] or [here][blog3]) I've chosen the easiest alternative, **Jekyll**.

Jekyll is *Ruby-based*, is oriented to what I was thinking for this site (just *writing without worrying*) and has a lot of resources available from the open source community (less than Wordpress, but is more open I think). Don't misunderstand me, **Wordpress is a very good software, but maybe a bit *overkiller* for what I need**.

I've made lists with different points of views. 

**In favour of Jekyll:**

* It's easy to set up and maintain (if you have experience with *Git* and *Ruby*).
* **You can focus in writing**.
* It's **statically served**, so your website will support a huge load without problems.
* You can use some free hosting like [GitHub Pages][ghpages] without ads and things like that.
* Modifying a template is as easier as writing normal HTML.
* It doesn't require high-end servers to run smoothly.

But **in favor of Wordpress** there are also several points:

* It's **easier to write post from anywhere** (you don't need a repository, just a browser).
* It has **a lot of plugins and themes** available from the first time you try it.
* The **content is dynamically generated**, so you can add as much dynamic contents as you want (*searches* or *last comments* for example).

To sum up, if you want to run a small blog without worrying, the most valuable option may be **Jekyll**, but if you don't have technical experience (and don't want to have it) or you need dynamically generated content, Wordpress is your guy.
