Yesterday I've attended to a conference of **Andres L. Martinez** (*aka* almo or [@davilagrau][twitter-url]) about the **Google Developer** environment, the presentation of the [Google Developer Group of Gij√≥n][gdggijon] and a presentation called **'Design, Develop and Distribute: Best Practices'** ([link][slides]). I can say that it was one of the most interesting conferences I've attended to, specially because of the Material Design explanation part.

**Material Design**, for those who don't know it, it's the lastest [design guideline][md-guideline] that Google has published, included in *Lollipop-ready* applications and in some web applications. It is based in a flat design, responsive (*mobile-ready*) and prepared to provide a comfortable user experience. Until yesterday I haven't heard anything about anything called **Polymer** ([link][polymer-link]), their framework to create web applications with Material Design, and since yesterday I'm looking for some free time to try it more deeply.

Another important point in the conference was to **introduce the lastest Google services for developers**, that are distributed following a **IaaS** (*Infrastructure as a Service*) and **PaaS** (*Platform as a Service*) schema. All of them seem very useful when developing web services or apps that require a huge quantity of resources and CPU power.

**If you want to take a look at the slides** used, they are available [here][slides].
