This week I've prepared and submitted three student proposals for **Google Summer of Code** ([link][gsoc]). GSoC is a project wich aim is to help students to start their participation in open source projects.

After an initial period in which the open source projects get in touch with google to participate, a list of accepted projects is published and now, until 27th march, the students can make their proposals to participate in their favourite projects. A proposal is like a letter in which you explain which idea do you want to develop and how you can do it.

I have sent three different proposals:

* **Ruby on Rails:** *Long Running Ruby and Rails Benchmarks*.
* **GitHub:** *Weighted scoring for detection strategies*.
* **OpenStreetMap:** *Web application to share 3D models within OSM applications*.

If you are a student in a university, you can contribute to an open source project working in a full-time job during the summer. The amount received as a scholarship is $5200, which is a good deal.

**Despite if you are a experienced developer or just a beginner**, it is a great opportunity to start contributing to an open source community, and get used to the tools and services used for this.
