Now that I'm ending my degree studies, my plan is to learn **NodeJS** during summer in order to improve my development skills, so I started last week finding out some documentation.

Thanks to a fellow (thanks [Pedro][pmareke]!) I reached this document, titled ['The Node Beginner Book'][nodebook], which guide you to do a basic upload tool. **Also, it do a successful guidance through some basic aspects of JavaScript** (like *function objects*) **or even some basic web methodologies**, like using a router for petitions, request handlers, etc.

I think that this book is a very good place to start (and available online!) so if anyone want to start on NodeJS world, this is in my opinion a good place to start.

Once you have finished it, the next step would be to check a framework to do everything on a higher level using [MVC architecture][mvc], like [ExpressJS][expressjs] in the case of NodeJS, or Rails in the case of Ruby.

Next week, I plan to **integrate MongoDB on the equation** to try to build something really useful like an API or something like that.

*Stay tunned!*
