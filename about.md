This website is maintained by me, [Ã“scar de Arriba](http://www.oscardearriba.com). I do this in my free time and when something interesting comes to my mind. Actually I'm finishing my studies in telecommunication's engineering.

I love web programming and designing (you can see my stuff on my [GitHub account](github.com/odarriba)), from the frontend to the backend and the system administration. My main programming language is **Ruby on Rails**, but I'm not scared about learning Node.js, Angular or any other new technology.

The aim of this blog is **to share every piece of code I wrote** or that I found on the Internet. A good base for solving complex problems is to find information about how other people have solved the same problem, so I've decided to share my experiences.

If you want to contact me, you can use the social networks that you can find above. Also, you can leave comments in the blog entries and I'll try to answer as soon as I can.
